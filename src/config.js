/*Explanation: The flickr API account creation did not work for me.  TeamTreeHouse support found me the Unsplash photo API to use as a replacement.
I have included 4 API clientIds because of request limits, which allows for more requests to be made if the active Id is switched with another id that is currently commented out.
30 requests is the limit, which means 10 photos are displayed per Gallery component as opposed to 24. */
